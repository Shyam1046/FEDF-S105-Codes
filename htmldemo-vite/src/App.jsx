        <p>In the beginning, an Outer God known as The Greater Will sent the Elden Ring to The Lands Between.
Queen Marika the Eternal became its vessel, ushering in a prosperous era.
She established the Golden Order under the grace of The Erdtree.
Her first consort, Godfrey, became the first Elden Lord, conquering the land.
After their wars were won, Marika exiled Godfrey and his warriors, who became the Tarnished.
In a mysterious act of defiance, Marika then shattered the Elden Ring.
Her demigod children each claimed a shard, a Great Rune, and were corrupted by its power.
This ignited a massive, ruinous war known as The Shattering.
The demigods fought to a brutal stalemate, leaving the world fractured.
The guidance of Grace abandoned the land, plunging it into endless decay.</p>
        <p> Long after, the guidance of Grace returns, but only to the exiled Tarnished.
You, a Tarnished of no renown, are called back to The Lands Between.
Your purpose is to stand before the now-broken Elden Ring.
Guided by Grace and the enigmatic Two Fingers, you must wage war.
The goal is to slay the shardbearing demigods and claim their Great Runes.
With these runes, you can gain entry to The Erdtree and repair the Ring.
However, various factions and Outer Gods vie for control of the coming age.
Choices made will align you with different powers, leading to different futures.
Whether you restore the Golden Order or usher in a new era is your decision.
Your destiny is to become the one true Elden Lord.</p>
